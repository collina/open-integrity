        <p> The Open Integrity Index will enable users to make sophisticated decisions about the tools they use for privacy and communications, without requiring a high-level security engineering background. </p>
        <p> OII has several distinct objectives, including:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li> Enabling users to make educated decisions about the tools they use and the ways in which they expose their personal information.</li>
			<li> Establishing a platform for the results of independent audits to be made accessible to a general audience.</li>
			<li> Providing a resource for other platforms, such as application markets, to integrate digital security into the decision-making process of installing software.</li>
			<li> Improving access to material on digital security principles in languages other than English. </li>
			<li> Promoting stronger awareness on fundamental precepts of privacy by design in the development of communications tools.</li>
			<li> Encouraging stronger relationships between developers and their communities of users.</li>
